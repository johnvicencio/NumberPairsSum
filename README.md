# Number Pairs Summation

## Introduction
Method that adds the digits of an integer. In this scenario, display sumation that is equal to 10, else show the numbers that do not equal to 10. For example, if <code>var num = 19</code>, '1' plus '9' is ten. Otherwise simply return the integer.

## Algorithm
1. Create a method that takes an integer: convert the integer into string to parse as char. 
2. Assign an integer as an argument to the method
3. Loop through up to value of integer
4. Call the method that displays either by summation of the digits or simply displaying those integerse that do not add to 10

## Instruction
1. Create a Console Application from Visual Studio
2. Open the Program.cs above
3. Replace content of your Program.cs on your new application
